    <h1>Whould you like a bite of tasty Croissant?</h1>
    <p>The croissant is only acceptable as a breakfast food and, unless you live a life of gilded luxury, only at
        weekends. It
        is a matter of time, cost and the fact that if you eat them regularly you will collapse of a heart attack at an
        unfashionably young age.</p>
